Applications you have to download.

>>> Python -                https://www.python.org/downloads/         (Get the lastest version available) 
            This is obviously required to run any python scripts.
            
>>> Arduino IDE -           https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software   (The Windows Store Version is okay, but I prefer the .exe (installer) version)
            This allows one to program the arduino devices. 
            
>>> Visual Studio Code -    https://code.visualstudio.com/            (Make sure to check if your PC is x64 or x32(x86) and download the appropriate one)
            A brilliant general coding environment ,it is open source and the amount of extentions are brilliant.
            
Applications I find useful, you dont need them but are useful.
